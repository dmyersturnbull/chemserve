Trivially craft an [facade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern) around [rdkit](https://www.rdkit.org/)
for conda-free code and better separation of concerns.

You make two uncoupled packages:
- A conda facade package thatd responds to JSON requests.
- A pip-installable client package that makes requests to the server.

Overlaps a little with [chembl_beaker](https://github.com/chembl/chembl_beaker/),
a REST server with several useful rdkit-backed functions.
Chemserve is much thinner and is equally happy with *any* rdkit-backed function.
Create and start a server with `ChemServe.server`:

```python
def function_to_perform(payload: Payload):
    print([c.inchikey for c in payload.compounds])         # print out our compounds
    print(c.params)                                        # print any arguments or flags
    return {"status: "all done"}                           # tell the client we finished

# start a new server that will listen form JSON payloads on port 1633
server = ChemServe.server(function_to_perform, port=1633)
```

### üí° Advantages / rationale

This has a few extremely useful properties:

- **Modularity:** Wrap complex systems like rdkit in [facades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern).
  Tests for your client code *can‚Äôt* depend on rdkit, leaving them uncoupled.
- **Conda independence:**
  Mixing pip and conda dependencies ‚Ä† can introduce [clobbering or silent conflicts](https://dmyersturnbull.github.io/#-the-python-build-landscape).
  Your server needs only rdkit, and your client can use any PyPi package.
- **Performance:** Conda is heavy, and its dependency resolution is slow (and less reliable) compared to
  [Poetry‚Äôs](https://python-poetry.org).
  Your facade‚Äôs public functions likely only delegate to a few rdkit calls, so updates can be infrequent.
  Your client can be tested quickly in conda-free continous integration, so you can make frequent changes.
- **Tooling:** By excluding Conda, you can use modern build, isolation, and CI/CD tools like [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
  See [Tyrannosaurus](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/tyrannosaurus) for an example pipeline. Also see how to
  [publish the facade to conda-forge](https://tyrannosaurus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/anaconda.html).
- **Asynchronous code:** Asynchronous calls can be made to numerically heavy rdkit code:
  Your client sends a request and independently handles payloads whenever they‚Äôre shipped back.

‚Ä† Rdkit has an [open issue](https://github.com/rdkit/rdkit/issues/1812) about pip installation.
Unfortunately, the Pip package would be massive and slow to install.

### üî® Installation

- Install the server in one package or plain conda environment: `conda install chemserve`
- And install the client in any packages that need it: `pip install chemserve`

Call `ChemServe.server(function, port)` in the server environment,
and call `ChemServe.client(port)` in the client package.

### üéÅ Baked-in functionality

This package provides some [convenient](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/chemserve/blob/master/chemserve/models.py)
[wrapper](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/chemserve/blob/master/chemserve/_concrete_base.py)
[classes](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/chemserve/blob/master/chemserve/graphics.py) to help build your facade.
You can pretty easily turn your daemon into a REST server and handle web requests.
There‚Äôs a baked-in server that generates structure SVGs and saves them to disk.

It‚Äôs all simpler than it sounds: See the examples below.

### üñåÔ∏è Example 1: draw compounds in a grid

Your server receives a `Payload` with parameters (`.params`) and a list of compounds (`.items`),
each wrapped up into a class that lazily stores the SMILES, inchi, inchikey, name, mol object, and optional identifier.
Each has convenience functions for things like getting fingerprints and deduplicating structures.

**Note:** Chemserve automatically sanitizes all payload structures as per rdkit.
Set `rdkit.Chem.rdmolops.SanitizeFlags.SANITIZE_NONE` to `False` to control this behavior.

Here‚Äôs an example that draws compounds on an m√ón grid.
(This particular example is actually built-in as `chemserve.drawing_service(port)`.)

```python
from chemserve import ChemServe, ChemGraphicsKit, BaseChem, Payload

def draw(payload: Payload) -> None:
  """
  Draws the compounds in a grid and saves SVG or PNG to disk.
  The payload should have params ``rows``, ``cols``, and ``path``.
  """
  rows, cols = payload.bool_param("rows"), payload.bool_param("cols")
  path = payload.str_param("path")
  grid = ChemGraphicsKit().draw_grid(payload.compounds, rows, cols)
  grid.save(path)

server = ChemServe.server(draw, port=1633)
client = server.client()  # just shorthand

client.send_multiple([BaseChem("InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2", "water", "U0001")], params=None)
```

### ‚úâÔ∏è Example 2: Calculate fingerprints and send them back

Here‚Äôs an example that desalts & de-duplicates molecules and calculates ECFP fingerprints:

```python
from chemserve import ChemServe, BaseChem, Chem

def fingerprint(chem: Chem, params):
    fprint = chem.desalt().deduplicate().fingerprint(radius=2, bits=4096)
    print(fprint)  # this will be a binary string; e.g. 011010111...
    # the dict will be encoded as JSON
    return dict(source_key=chem.key, n_on=fprint.n_on, n_off=fprint.n_off

# a 'per_compound" server (takes one compound at a time)
# you can add a additional "tasks" 
server = ChemServe.per_compound().map("main", fingerprint).build(1633)

# make a client (ordinarily this would happen on another process or remotely)
client = ChemServe.client(1633)

# this will just return None if nothing was received, so
# you can handle these asynchronously
client.receive()

# send a compound
water = BaseChem("InChI=1S/H2O/h1H2", name="water", key="U0001")
client.send_one(water)
```

### üîå Using chembl_beaker

You might want to use some nice functions from chembl_beaker.
For simplicity and better performance, you should bypass the Tornado / webserver parts of beaker functions.
For example, you may want to standardize molecules the way ChEMBL does in [ChEMBL_Structure_Pipeline](https://github.com/chembl/ChEMBL_Structure_Pipeline).
Beaker provides that in [standarisation/views](https://github.com/chembl/chembl_beaker/blob/master/src/chembl_beaker/beaker/core_apps/standarisation/views.py).

You *could* set up a chembl_beaker server and send a `POST` to `/getParent/`,
but it‚Äôs cleaner and faster to use the corresponding function in [standardisation/impl](https://github.com/chembl/chembl_beaker/blob/master/src/chembl_beaker/beaker/core_apps/standarisation/impl.py),
which takes mol block strings (`.mol` files) as input (as the `data` argument):

```python
def _get_parent(data, loadMol=False, useRDKitChemistry=False):
   ...
```

For this particular example, you could of course just call ChEMBL_Structure_Pipeline directly:
`from chembl_structure_pipeline import standardizer, checker`

### üò± The situation that sparked this package

This was written to isolate needed functionality from rdkit
so that the rest of an [analysis package](https://github.com/dmyersturnbull/sauronlab)
could be installed through Poetry.
Otherwise, I had some dependencies only on PyPi and others only on Conda,
so each would overwrite the other‚Äôs dependencies.

There are two components:
- The server, installable through conda. It just sits and waits.
- The client, which is just a wrapper to build and send JSON payloads.

The client is installable through pip/poetry. However, the daemon won‚Äôt work this way!  
The server depends on rdkit, so it cannot be installed through pip.
The conda recipe specifies rdkit as a dependency.\
